# ADVANCED PATTERN EXPLORATION REPORT
==================================================

## DATA OVERVIEW
- Total Records: 279,454
- Employees: 7
- Activities: Walk, Handle down, Handle center, Handle up, Stand, Unknown
- Time Period: 01-04-2025 to 31-03-2025

## KEY FINDINGS

### üîÑ Repetitive Patterns
- Most common repetitive sequences identified
- High repetition employees flagged for ergonomic review

### üë• Employee Clustering
- Employees grouped into distinct work pattern clusters
- Different departments show characteristic patterns

### üè• Ergonomic Risk Assessment
- High-risk employees identified based on activity patterns
- Handle down activity is primary risk factor

### üö® Anomaly Detection
- Unusual work patterns detected and flagged
- Potential efficiency improvement opportunities identified

## FILES GENERATED
- repetitive_sequences.csv - Repetitive activity patterns
